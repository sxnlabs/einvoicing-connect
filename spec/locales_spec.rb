# i18n-tasks does not work on this gem: every lookup goes through
# `::I18n.t` with a fully qualified
# `einvoicing.connect.` key, and its scanners only recognise a literal
# `I18n.t("full.key")`. It reported zero keys in use — which made `missing`
# falsely perfect and `unused` falsely total — while dragging railties and
# forty other gems into the lockfile. This spec replaces its `missing` side with
# no dependencies, by lexing the call sites the gem actually writes. It does not
# replace `unused`: keys are also built by interpolation here, so nothing can
# tell an orphan from a key only ever reached dynamically.
