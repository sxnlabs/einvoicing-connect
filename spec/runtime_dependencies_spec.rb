# A gem that `require`s a library it does not declare works fine in its own
# repository — the library is already there, dragged in by some development
# dependency — and raises LoadError in the consumer's bundle. Ruby 3.4 moved
# `base64` out of the default gems, which is exactly how that bug reached this
# gem: `#cpro_account_header` was covered by a green spec the whole time,
# because `activesupport` (via `rubocop-rails`) put base64 in the development
# lock. The green test proved the opposite of what it looked like.
#
# This spec reads `lib/` instead of loading the gem in an isolated bundle,
# because it has to fail on a machine where the library IS installed. Loading
# the gem cannot do that either: the require that started all this sits inside
# a method body and never runs at load time.

  # Checked by loading each one inside a bundle whose lock contains none of
  # them, on the floor Ruby (3.2) and on the current release.
  #
  # A default gem can be demoted to a bundled gem in a later Ruby — that is what
  # happened to base64 in 3.4. When it does, the entry moves out of this list
  # and into the gemspec as a real dependency.
